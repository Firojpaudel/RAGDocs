## 🚀 **RAG-Tastic Journey**

I embarked on the journey to implement **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** using the **OpenAI API**.  
Armed with my code editor, a solid plan, and a lot of caffeine, I was ready to dive deep into the project. But, as all good stories go, there was an unexpected twist...

## 💥 The Challenge

Just when things were starting to get interesting, I hit an unfortunate snag: **Rate Limits**.  
Yes, the dreaded **429 Error**—a reminder that the OpenAI API has its limits, and I had reached mine for now.

## ⏸️ **Current Status: Project Paused**

While the rate limit has temporarily slowed my progress, it hasn't stopped the journey altogether.  
Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes:

- **Code Refactoring**: Improving the efficiency of my approach.
- **Planning the Next Steps**: Considering token management, API strategies, and overall architecture improvements.
- **README Updates**: Keeping things transparent and informative as I work through these hurdles.

## 🔮 **What’s Next?**

This is just a temporary pause. Once I’ve navigated around the rate limits, I’ll dive right back into the implementation and continue the project.  
Feel free to share insights, feedback, or suggestions in the meantime.

Stay tuned for updates.
